This is the [tutorial](https://teamnewpipe.github.io/documentation/) for the [NewPipeExtractor](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor).
It is for those who want to write their own service, or use NewPipeExtractor in their own projects.

This tutorial and the documentation are in an early state. So [feedback](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/documentation/issues) is always welcome :D

The tutorial is created using [`mkdocs`](http://www.mkdocs.org/). You can test and host it your self by running `mkdocs serve` in the root
directory of this project. If you want to deploy your changes and you are one of the maintainers you can run `mkdocs gh-deploy && git push`.
